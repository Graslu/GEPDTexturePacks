Perfect Dark HD Font/Menu Texture Pack by Trov

This texture pack updates only the UI elements of Perfect Dark, to make
the menus and fonts look good and legible at 4K resolution and up.
The font graphics are 8x the size of the original game.

INSTALLATION: Move "Perfect Dark" folder into your emulator's Plugin/hires_texture folder.
Make sure your N64 video plugin is configured to enable texture packs and load from this folder.
I developed this pack for GLideN64 v4.0, with "Alternate CRC calculation" turned OFF, with 1964 emulator.
I cannot guarantee how well the pack works with other plugins or emulators.

DETAILS:
This pack includes 5 fonts:
	-Normal font, used by subtitles & item pickup text & the menu
	-Big font, used for big menu items, mission select screen, objectives update, firing range scores
	-Biggest font, used to my knowledge only in the startup screen and credits
	-Small Caps, used for menu sideways text, weapon/firemode selection, inventory menu description and CamSpy
	-Ammo Count, the numbers next to the ammo bars
		-I designed the Ammo Count numbers to be a middle ground between Perfect Dark's curvy font and the original
			square number graphics.
	
This pack also includes other UI elements that are not fonts:
-All mission preview images for Solo Mission menu including special assignments & 'New Agent' image
	-Some images are pretty different than the originals, because I was limited to what I can see in game, but
		I tried to preserve the spirit as closely as possible.
	-The preview images have a small blue border, to cover up a glitch that duplicates pixels near the top and left edges otherwise.
-Star graphics used for solo mission completion medals, Combat Sim challenges, firing range challenges, Combat Sim postgame awards
-N64 controller image used in 'Controls' menu
-Target score circles for post-Firing Range score screen
-Radar circle 
	-I cannot get the game to display it even with no texture pack, so I can't confirm how it looks.
